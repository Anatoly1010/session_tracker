# Claude Session Tracker

A tiny local web UI over your Claude Code session transcripts
(`~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`). Shows **session ID · folder · scope**
plus last-activity time and message counts. No dependencies (Python stdlib
only), read-only w.r.t. Claude's data, indexed into a local SQLite file.

## Run

```bash
cd ~/q/session_tracker
python3 session_tracker.py            # http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Then open the URL. Search box filters label/scope/id/folder/first-prompt; the
folder dropdown narrows to one project; column headers sort; **↻ Rescan**
re-indexes new or changed sessions on demand.

- **Click a row** to expand a short details panel: resume command, full
  session ID, folder, start/last time + duration, message counts, model, and
  the first/last prompt.
- **✎ Rename** sets a custom label that overrides the (sometimes misleading)
  auto scope. Labels are stored separately and survive rescans; blank clears
  it. The original scope stays visible underneath.
- **★ Star** — the leftmost column toggles a favorite. Starred sessions also
  collect under the **Favorites** tab (same rows, resume, and transcript view).
  Stars live in a separate table, so a rescan never clears them.
- **📝 Notes** — the details panel has a free-text note box; **Save note** stores
  a private note for that session. A 📝 marker then appears next to its scope
  (hover to read the note), and note text is included in the search box. Notes
  live in their own table too, so rescans never drop them.
- **Resume** — the details panel shows `cd <folder> && claude --resume <id>`
  with a ⧉ copy button; paste it in a terminal to continue that session.
- **View full conversation** — opens a modal reader that reconstructs the whole
  transcript: your prompts and Claude's replies as bubbles, tool calls collapsed
  into expandable `⚙` blocks (each showing its input and result), and Claude's
  internal thinking hidden behind a **thinking** toggle. Close with ✕, the
  backdrop, or Esc. Deep-linkable via `#t/<session-id>`.

## Ideas tab

The **💡 Ideas** tab is a standalone bullet list for things to try in future
sessions — not tied to any particular session. Type an idea in the box and press
**Enter** or **＋ Add**. Each idea gets a checkbox (☐/☑), and clicking one marks
it done — completed ideas strike through and sink to the bottom while open ones
stay on top. The **✕** deletes an idea; the header shows an `N open · M total`
count.

- **Details & category** — click an idea (or its ▶ caret) to expand an inline
  editor: rename the idea, give it a **category**, and add a free-text
  **details / notes** field for extra context. A category chip and a 📝 marker
  (hover to read the details) then show on the collapsed row. The category field
  autocompletes from categories you've already used.
- **Sort** — the *Sort* dropdown orders the list by **Added** (creation order),
  **Category** (alphabetical, uncategorised last), or **Status** (open first).

Ideas live in their own `ideas` table (`id / text / details / category / done /
created`, served by `/api/ideas`), so they persist across restarts and rescans
and never interact with the session index.

## Memory tab

The **Memory** toggle (top of the page) switches to a browser over Claude's
per-project memory (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/*.md`). Pick a project
from the dropdown to see its memories as cards (title, type badge, description,
size/date):

- **⧉ Copy** puts a memory's full markdown on your clipboard, ready to paste
  into a chat.
- **View** expands the memory inline.
- **Import to…** copies that memory file into another project's `memory/` dir
  and appends its line to that project's `MEMORY.md`. It won't overwrite an
  existing file of the same name, import the `MEMORY.md` index itself, or
  import into the same project. After a successful import a toast offers
  **Undo**, which deletes the copied file and removes the line it added. Import
  is the only place the tool writes to Claude's data — everything else is
  read-only.

## Insights tab

A third tab with a few interactive charts computed from the session index
(pure inline SVG, no libraries):

- **Stat tiles** — total sessions, messages, active days, projects.
- **Sessions per day** — column chart across your active date range.
- **Top projects** — horizontal bars ranked by session count.
- **Activity** — a weekday × hour heatmap of when sessions start (local time).

Hover any mark for a tooltip. Charts re-fit on window resize. Tabs are
deep-linkable via the URL hash (`#sessions`, `#favorites`, `#ideas`, `#memory`,
`#insights`).

## Theme

The UI uses Atomize's dark palette (from `atomize/general_modules/gui_style.py`):
indigo background `#2a2a40`, lavender text `#c1cae3`, gold accent `#d3c24e`. All
shades derive from those base colors via CSS `color-mix`, so re-skinning is just
editing the `--bg` / `--base` / `--fg` / `--accent` variables in the `:root`
block near the top of the embedded stylesheet.

## Options

```
--port 9000            # change port (default 8765)
--host 0.0.0.0         # bind address (default 127.0.0.1, localhost only)
--projects DIR         # transcript root (default ~/.claude/projects)
--db PATH              # sqlite index location (default ./sessions.db)
--scan-only            # rebuild the index and exit (no server)
```

## Windows

Works the same — it's pure Python stdlib. On Windows:

```
py session_tracker.py            # or: python session_tracker.py
```

Transcripts are read at `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects` (i.e. `~/.claude`),
the same default as macOS/Linux; pass `--projects` if yours live elsewhere.
Files are read as UTF-8 so non-ASCII (Cyrillic, emoji, …) is safe. The resume
command is emitted in cmd.exe form — `cd /d "<folder>" && claude --resume <id>`
— which handles drive changes and spaces. In **PowerShell**, `&&` works in
PowerShell 7+; on Windows PowerShell 5.1 run the two parts on separate lines
(`cd "<folder>"` then `claude --resume <id>`).

## What "scope" means

Per session it's the model's own AI title for the session (`ai-title`
record). If a session has none yet, it falls back to the first real user
prompt, then to the last prompt.

## How indexing works

On startup (and on Rescan) it walks every `*.jsonl` transcript and stores one
row per session in `sessions.db`. Re-scans are incremental: a transcript is
only re-parsed if its size or modification time changed, so refreshes are
fast even with large histories.
